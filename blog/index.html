  <h2>Democracy, social mobility, and culture</h2>
  <div class="date">January 24, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">There is a good amount of evidence that cultural values and beliefs are important for various life outcomes. This is quite intuitive. For instance, think of two imaginary people: one believes that hard work brings success, the other believes that success is a matter of luck and connections. On average, it can be expected that the first person will be willing to invest more in education, skills, and work more and harder in general.<br><br>

But where do these differences in views about the role of hard work between these two people come from? What is the origin of these cultural differences? This is the question I attempt to answer in my paper entitled "Democracy, social mobility, and culture".</div>

  <h2>International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination, and economic growth</h2>
  <div class="date">January 17, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">Persecuted groups (usually ethnolinguistic/religious minorities) in various countries can theoretically escape discrimination by emigration. This means that immigration policies around the world can potentially interact with discriminatory behavior. For instance, a government that discriminates against a group might decide to reduce discrimination if the threat of emigration for that group is higher.<br><br>

Is this really the case? Are persecuted groups really more likely to emigrate? And how does immigration policy and discrimination interact with each other? These are the questions that paper entitled "International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination, and economic growth" tackles.</div>
