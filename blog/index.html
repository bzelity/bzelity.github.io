  <h2>The circular economy, international trade, and the sectoral composition of economies</h2>
  <div class="date">March 22, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">Major economies like the European Union, Japan and China have been increasingly interested in making their economies more "circular". As opposed to a traditional "linear" economy, which extracts, consumes, and then dumps resources, a circular economy emphasizes the reduction, reuse and recycling of existing resources.<br><br>

The reasons for going circular are many. Given that many advanced economies are largely resource-poor, most resources need to be imported, often from unstable autocratic regimes. For this reason, over-reliance on external trading partners for resources can be a major national security issue. In addition, given that most critical resources are non-renewable, the sustainability of linear economic systems is questionable. Finally, the pollution associated with the extraction and dumping of resources can have important environmental implications.<br><br>

The case for the circular economy, therefore, looks strong for advanced economies. In our research, however, we take a more global perspective. We examine the impact of advanced economies going circular on global raw material markets and, through these markets, on both more and less advanced economies.</div>

<!--  <h2>Democracy, social mobility, and culture</h2>
  <div class="date">January 24, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">There is a good amount of evidence that cultural values and beliefs are important for various life outcomes. This is quite intuitive. For instance, think of two imaginary people: one believes that hard work brings success, the other believes that success is a matter of luck and connections. On average, it can be expected that the first person will be willing to invest more in education, skills, and work more and harder in general.<br><br>

But where do these differences in views about the role of hard work between these two people come from? What is the origin of these cultural differences? This is the question I attempt to answer in my paper entitled "Democracy, social mobility, and culture".</div>

  <h2>International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination, and economic growth</h2>
  <div class="date">January 17, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">Persecuted groups (usually ethnolinguistic/religious minorities) in various countries can theoretically escape discrimination by emigration. This means that immigration policies around the world can potentially interact with discriminatory behavior. For instance, a government that discriminates against a group might decide to reduce discrimination if the threat of emigration for that group is higher.<br><br>

Is this really the case? Are persecuted groups really more likely to emigrate? And how does immigration policy and discrimination interact with each other? These are the questions that paper entitled "International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination, and economic growth" tackles.</div>
