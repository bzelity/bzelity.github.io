  <h2>International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination, and economic growth</h2>
  <div class="date">January 17, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">Persecuted groups (usually ethnolinguistic/religious minorities) in various countries can theoretically escape discrimination by emigration. This means that immigration policies around the world can potentially interact with discriminatory behavior. For instance, a government that discriminates against a group might decide to reduce discrimination if the threat of emigration for that group is higher.<br><br>

Is this really the case? Are persecuted groups really more likely to emigrate? And how does immigration policy and discrimination interact with each other? These are the questions that my paper entitled "International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination, and economic growth" tackles.<br><br>

To start with, consider a simple economic framework with two types of people: a majority and a minority group. The government is controlled by the majority, and it can discriminate against the minority. It does so by imposing a "discrimination tax" on the minority. The minority can escape this tax by emigrating, but emigration is costly. So there is a trade-off: whether to emigrate or be discriminated against.<br><br>

The government sets the discrimination tax rate in order to maximize its revenue. If the tax rate is too low, then the government's revenue from discrimination is low. If the tax rate is too high, then most minorities emigrate, and revenue is once again low. There is thus an optimal tax rate at some intermediate level.<br><br>

Of course, this framework is not to be interpreted literally: no government imposes a literal discrimination tax. Instead, this simple model is meant to capture the idea that the government can potentially crack down on discrimination (equivalent to lowering the tax) or be lenient and allow it (equivalent to increasing the tax). And so the question we ask now is whether the government's choice can be impacted by immigration policy abroad.<br><br>

There are several interesting insights coming out of this model.<br>

<ul>
<li>The more emigrants are accepted abroad (i.e. the more liberal immigration policies foreign countries have), the less the domestic government will discriminate. This makes sense because if the minority can "vote with its feet" more easily, then discrimination will just lead to emigration, and government revenues from the discrimination tax will be low. So the government discriminates less.</li>

<li>The more emigrants are accepted abroad, the lower the desire of persecuted minorities to emigrate. This paradoxical result is explained by the fact that more liberal immigration policies lower discrimination in the home country, so desire to emigrate actually decreases. The net effect on emigration rates is therefore ambiguous.</li>

<li>The more emigrants are accepted abroad, the more the persecuted minority will invest in education. This is because individuals with higher human capital have a better chance to successfully emigrate. This in turn will increase the inequality in education between the minority and the majority if the minority is more educated to begin with (which is the case for most developing countries).</li>
</ul><br>

Are these predictions borne out by the data? That is unfortunately hard to tell, and is mostly outside the scope of this paper. What the paper does show, however, using unique ethnolinguistic group-level data is the following.<br>

<ul>
<li>Persecuted groups (which are most often, but not always, minorities) do indeed have a higher desire to emigrate than the dominant group in their country on average.</li>

<li>Smaller groups have a higher desire to emigrate, which makes sense because they're easier to discriminate against.</li>

<li>Persecuted groups have a much higher desire to emigrate relative to the dominant group in countries that are less democratic. This makes sense as well, because less democratic countries can conceivably be more likely to discriminate. So more discrimination (as proxied by a lack of democracy) does indeed lead to a higher desire to emigrate, as predicted by the model.</li>
</ul><br>

This paper therefore suggests immigration policy in developed countries can potentially be an effective tool in combatting discrimination in developing countries. Of course, more research is needed (especially using data) to make a definitive conclusion that this is indeed the case.</div><br><br>
