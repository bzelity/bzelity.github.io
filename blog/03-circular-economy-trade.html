  <h2>The circular economy, international trade, and the sectoral composition of economies</h2>
  <div class="date">March 22, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">Major economies like the European Union, Japan and China have been increasingly interested in making their economies more "circular". As opposed to a traditional "linear" economy, which extracts, consumes, and then dumps resources, a circular economy emphasizes the reduction, reuse and recycling of existing resources.<br><br>

The reasons for going circular are many. Given that many advanced economies are largely resource-poor, most resources need to be imported, often from unstable autocratic regimes. For this reason, over-reliance on external trading partners for resources can be a major national security issue. In addition, given that most critical resources are non-renewable, the sustainability of linear economic systems is questionable. Finally, the pollution associated with the extraction and dumping of resources can have important environmental implications.<br><br>

The case for the circular economy, therefore, looks strong for advanced economies. In our research, however, we take a more global perspective. We examine the impact of advanced economies going circular on global raw material markets and, through these markets, on both more and less advanced economies.<br><br>

Given that advanced economies are still largely linear, our research studies a hypothetical future in which advanced economies reduce their need to import raw materials by going more circular. As such, our research relies on a simple model of the global economy, which helps us make projections about the future. On the surface, our model is simple. There are multiple countries, and each country has three sectors: manufacturing, mining, and recycling. People consume manufactured goods, which are produced using raw material and labor. Raw material in turn can be produced either by mining or by recycling. The countries can trade manufactured goods and raw material with each other.<br><br>

In this set-up, we simulate the hypothetical scenario of going more circular by making a country dramatically increase the fraction of output it recycles. This is <a class="text" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323825004_Defining_and_measuring_the_circular_economy_A_mathematical_approach" target="_blank">fitting for a study of the circular economy</a> as large-scale recycling scemes form a key part of circular initiatives.<br><br>

Another key theme in the way we simulate our model is that we assume that, for the time being, only advanced economies go more circular. In addition, advanced economies in our model are largely resource-poor, while the poorer economies in our model are resource-rich. This corresponds very well to the current situation of global raw material markets where, aside from a few exceptions such as Australia and Canada, most resource-rich economies are low- or middle-income countries.<br><br>

Our study's two key findings are the following.<br>

<ul>
<li>Not surprisingly, increased recycling in advanced economies reduces the demand for raw material in these countries, which allows them reduce their raw material imports. This then has a negative effect on global raw material prices. Circular initiatives can therefore exert a downward pressure on global raw material prices.</li>
<li>Given that raw material prices are lower in a more circular world, the poor countries that extensively rely on raw material extraction will find it optimal to divert resources from mining to manufacturing. In other words, low raw material prices make mining less profitable, and therefore they can act as an incentive for poor countries to switch to manufacturing instead.</li>
</ul><br>

Our two findings are deeply interconnected, and they reveal both a positive and a negative message. First, it appears that advanced economies going circular can trigger a transition from mining to manufacturing in the developing world. This is great news as manufacturing has been widely lauded as an important factor in moving countries towards upper-middle and high-income status.<br><br>

Nevertheless, this transition occurs in our model because we assume that each country's government does what is best for the country given the situation in the global raw material and manufactured good markets. Reality is messier than that. In particular, it is not inconceivable that low raw material prices will make poor resource-rich countries more unstable due to a lack of jobs and a strain on government budgets. And while the economic fundamentals to transition to manufacturing in this situation will be present, it takes a pro-active and tactful government to orchestrate such a move, especially in the face of potential socio-economic tensions.<br><br>

Finally, it's worth asking what this all means for advanced economies. Will they be unambiguously better off if they go more circular? The answer is actually not that straightforward. The key reason is that going circular means that advanced economies will have to produce their own raw material, primarily via  recycling. This will require these countries to divert some resources (such as labor) from  activities such as manufacturing to recycling. We find that this is optimal to do, but only up to a certain point. Recycling a very large chunk of output would require too many resources being devoted to recycling, which would damage the welfare of advanced economies overall.<br><br>

We find, however, that, not too suprisingly, investment in better recycling technologies that allow advanced economies to recycle more with the same amount of resources can push these upper limits on recycling out.<br><br>

In sum, our paper cautions global policymakers to pay attention to a variety of things instead of just blindly going more circular. First, there can be a serious impact in the developing world, which can be positive for development, but only with careful management. Second, investment in increasing recycling capacity should be paralleled with investments in improving recycling technology. Otherwise, large-scale recycling schemes can be net loss for advanced economies.</div><br><br>
