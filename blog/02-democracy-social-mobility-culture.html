  <h2>Democracy, social mobility, and culture</h2>
  <div class="date">January 24, 2018</div>
  <div class="content">There is a good amount of evidence that cultural values and beliefs are important for various life outcomes. This is quite intuitive. For instance, think of two imaginary people: one believes that hard work brings success, the other believes that success is a matter of luck and connections. On average, it can be expected that the first person will be willing to invest more in education, skills, and work more and harder in general. Is this really the case?<br><br>

And where do these differences in views about the role of hard work between these two people come from? What is the origin of these cultural differences? These are the questions I attempt to answer in my paper entitled "Democracy, social mobility, and culture".<br><br>

In particular, the paper examines the role of these types of cultural factors in determining the social mobility of people relative to their parents (i.e. whether one gets more or less education than their parents and by how much), and where these cultural differences originate from.<br><br>

To start with, I document that, as expected, cultural beliefs, such as the belief that hard work brings success, are tightly correlated with social mobility. This is of course not too surprising. But where do these cultural differences come from? My prime candidate to explain them in this paper is parental exposure to democracy. In other words, I find that if a person's parents were primarily raised in more democratic societies, then that person will tend to see the world in a more meritocratic light (i.e. believe that hard work does lead to success), and that this will consequently translate into higher upward social mobility.<br><br>

How do I establish these results? In short, I use a data set on second-generation immigrants in the United States. These people were all born in the same country (the US) so they themselves were all exposed to the same set of institutions and the same level of democracy. But their parents come from a variety of countries. I find that people whose parents come from more democratic countries are the ones who are more upwardly mobile. These results hold after controlling for various individual characteristics. And given the nature of the data set, I am also able to compare people whose parents came from the same countries. For instance, I can compare people whose parents came from Germany in the 1930s to people whose parents came from Germany in the 1960s. Even with such restrictions, the results are there.<br><br>

Why might this be the case? Democracy <a class="text" href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jeurec/v14y2016i6p1401-1436.html" target="_blank">has been shown</a> to have a long-lasting positive effect on various indicators such as social capital or honesty. This could be explained by the fact that democracy allows people's voices to be heard, which can incentivize participation in communal activities and incentivize voicing one's opninion. There is also <a class="text" href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v100y2010i5p2205-29.html" target="_blank">evidence</a> that people react more positively to the same policy when it is imposed democractically (i.e. chosen by the people) than when it is imposed autocratically (i.e. by a dictator without consulting the people).<br><br>

So democracy can certainly have various positive effects on people's behavior and their cultural beliefs. But why does parental exposure to democracy matter for children? This is in fact the key result of the paper: parental exposure matters because institutions (such as democracy) can have a long lasting effect on one's cultural beliefs. For example, someone who lives in e.g. not so democratic 1920s Italy will on average believe less in meritocracy due to the autocratic environment. Then suppose that this person moves to the United States, which is democratic. Surely, their beliefs about meritocracy will become more positive. But despite becoming more positive, my paper shows that some of the influences of 1920s Italy will remain: the person will not believe as much that hard work brings success as someone who immigrated e.g. from the more democratic 1920s UK. And it is this 'residual meritocracy deficit' that this person will also transmit to their children. There is a large literature on the intergenerational transmission of cultural norms, which shows that parents indeed transfer their beliefs to their children. It is this effect of e.g. 1920s Italy that we are still able to pick up in the data today, and that manifests itself in the form of lower social mobility for children of parents from less democratic societies.<br><br>

Of course, I don't claim that factors such as this explain all differences in cultural values: I am merely documenting one particular channel that is also quite interesting because it shows the long shadow of historical institutions.</div><br><br>
