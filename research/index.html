  <h3>Age diversity and economic growth</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="papers/04_age_diversity_growth.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs04');">abstract / summary</a>] [blog post coming soon]</div>
  <div id="abs04" class="hidden">This research explores the impact of age diversity on economic growth. First, we build a model with skill complementarity between young and old workers, which gives rise to positive returns to age diversity. The model also suggests that returns to age diversity are lower in economies whose sectoral composition is biased towards a given age group's skills. Second, we take our two testable predictions to the data. Using country-level panel data with a novel instrument, regional data from Europe, and grid cell-level data, we find support for both of our hypotheses. Our results suggest that a one standard deviation increase in age diversity is associated with a 47\% increase in GDP per capita. Third, using age-specific population projections for 2015-2100, we estimate the impact of future changes in age diversity on income per capita around the world. We find that middle-income countries will be the biggest beneficiaries of future changes in age diversity.</div><br>
  
  <h3>The circular economy, international trade, and the sectoral composition of economies</h3>

  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jf_Garcia-Barragan2/publication/323662667_The_circular_economy_international_trade_and_the_sectoral_composition_of_economies/links/5aa291fda6fdcc22e2d34b2b/The-circular-economy-international-trade-and-the-sectoral-composition-of-economies.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs03');">abstract / summary</a>] [blog post coming soon]</div>
  <div id="abs03" class="hidden">There has been a recent trend in a number of major economies towards the introduction of large-scale recycling schemes. This research explores the potential impact of such schemes on the sectoral composition of economies through its effects on global raw material markets. We build a multi-country multi-sector model of recycling and trade, which shows that increased recycling in rich resource-poor countries incentivizes these countries' poor resource-rich trade partners to transition from mining to manufacturing. The model suggests that the channel for this transition is decreased global raw material demand, which exerts a downward pressure on raw material prices. Numerical simulations of our model indicate that the quantitative effects of increased recycling via this mechanism are significant.</div><br>
  
  <h3>Democracy, social mobility, and culture</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="papers/02_democracy_social_mobility_culture.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs02');">abstract / summary</a>] [<a class="text" href="../blog/02-democracy-social-mobility-culture.html">blog</a>]</div>
  <div id="abs02" class="hidden">This research explores the impact of democracy on cultural beliefs, the possibility of transferring such beliefs to the next generation, and the ensuing effects on social mobility. In particular, we establish that people from more democratic societies have cultural values that are conducive to social mobility, that these views are retained after emigration, and are to some extent transmitted to second-generation immigrant children. We further show that this intergenerational transmission of cultural traits is strongly associated with second-generation immigrants' social mobility relative to their parents. Identification primarily focuses on within-origin country variation in democracy over time. We find that individuals whose parents hail from more democratic societies experience significantly more upward mobility on average.</div><br>
  
  <h3>International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination and economic development</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('pdf01');">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs01');">abstract / summary</a>] [<a class="text" href="../blog/01-international-labor-mobility.html">blog</a>]</div>

  <div id="abs01" class="hidden">This paper examines the relationship between migration and discrimination, and how migration policy may affect discrimination. First, making use of a unique dataset, I confirm that there exists selection into emigration by ethnic or religious affiliation. The analysis indicates that this may be at least partially driven by discrimination. Second, building on the results of the empirical analysis, I extend a model of discrimination and migration, which reproduces the main conclusions drawn from the data. Third, the model is calibrated and simulated to shed more light on the research question. It is found that more liberal migration policies can alleviate discrimination in source countries. On the other hand, their effects on the migration rate can be either positive or negative depending on the type of reform, and they may reinforce inequalities in educational attainment among different ethnolinguistic or religious groups within a country.</div><br></td>
