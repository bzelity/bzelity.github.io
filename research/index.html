  <h3>Age diversity, skill-biased technical change and economic growth</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('pdf04');">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs04');">abstract / summary</a>] [blog post coming soon]</div>

  <div id="abs04" class="hidden">This research explores the role of age diversity in determining economic output. Age diversity has two conflicting effects on output. On the one hand, due to skill complementarity between different cohorts, age diversity can be beneficial. On the other hand, rapid skill-biased technological change makes age diversity costly as up-to-date human capital tends to be concentrated among younger cohorts. To study this trade-off,  we first build an overlapping-generations (OLG) model which predicts a hump-shaped relationship between age diversity and GDP per capita driven by these two opposing forces. We then test this prediction using country-level panel data with a novel instrument, and regional data from Europe. We find that moving one standard deviation closer to the optimal level of age diversity is associated with a 1.5% increase in GDP per capita. We also find that, consistent with the predictions of the model, the optimal level of age diversity is lower in economies where skill-biased technological change is more prevalent. Finally, using age-specific population projections for 2020-2100, we simulate the effects of immigration, fertility, and retirement policies on age diversity, and through it on output per capita. </div><br>
  
  <h3>The circular economy, international trade, and the sectoral composition of economies</h3>
  <div class="date">joint with <a class="text" href="https://sites.google.com/view/jfgarciabarragan" target="_blank">Juan García-Barragán</a></div>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jf_Garcia-Barragan2/publication/323662667_The_circular_economy_international_trade_and_the_sectoral_composition_of_economies/links/5aa291fda6fdcc22e2d34b2b/The-circular-economy-international-trade-and-the-sectoral-composition-of-economies.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs03');">abstract / summary</a>] [<a class="text" href="../blog/03-circular-economy-trade.html">blog</a>]</div>
  <div id="abs03" class="hidden">There has been a recent trend in a number of major economies towards the introduction of large-scale recycling schemes. This research explores the potential impact of such schemes on the sectoral composition of economies through its effects on global raw material markets. We build a multi-country multi-sector model of recycling and trade, which shows that increased recycling in rich resource-poor countries incentivizes these countries' poor resource-rich trade partners to transition from mining to manufacturing. The model suggests that the channel for this transition is decreased global raw material demand, which exerts a downward pressure on raw material prices. Numerical simulations of our model indicate that the quantitative effects of increased recycling via this mechanism are significant.</div><br>
  
  <h3>Democracy, social mobility, and culture</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="papers/02_democracy_social_mobility_culture.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs02');">abstract / summary</a>] [<a class="text" href="../blog/02-democracy-social-mobility-culture.html">blog</a>]</div>
  <div id="abs02" class="hidden">In this paper, we investigate the role of parental exposure to democratic institutions in shaping social mobility. First, we find that people whose parents hail from more democratic societies experience more upward mobility. This result is established in a sample of second-generation immigrants in the United States. Identification primarily focuses on exploiting within-origin-country variation in democracy over time. Second, we investigate the potential channel for this finding. We find that people in more democratic societies believe more in meritocracy, and that this difference in beliefs translates into higher upward mobility. Our results imply that people who grew up in more democratic societies hold more favorable beliefs about meritocracy, that these beliefs are retained after emigration, and are transmitted to the next generation. This ultimately affects how successful second-generation immigrant children are relative to their parents.</div><br>
  
  <h3>Output volatility and growth: combining panel data with an instrument</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="papers/05_output_volatility_growth.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs05');">abstract / summary</a>]</div>
  <div id="abs05" class="hidden">The effect of output volatility on long-run economic growth is still an unsettled question in the literature. This paper contributes to this question by proposing a new instrument for output volatility that allows for the estimation of the volatility-growth relationship in panel data. We instrument output volatility using the volatility of a commodity terms of trade index. The panel nature of this instrument allows us to focus on within-country variation by adding both country and time period fixed effects into our specifications. The key contribution of this paper is the combination of addressing endogeneity with an instrument and focusing on within-country variation using panel data techniques. Our finding is that output volatility and long-run growth are negatively associated: a 1% increase in output volatility leads to a 0.028 percentage point lower average annual growth rate over the long run.</div><br></td>
