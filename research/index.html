  <h2>Working papers</h2>
  
  <h3>Democracy, social mobility, and culture</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="papers/social_mobility_state.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs02');">abstract / summary</a>] [<a class="text" href="../blog/02-democracy-social-mobility-culture.html">blog</a>]</div>
  <div id="abs02" class="hidden">This research explores the impact of democracy on cultural beliefs, the possibility of transferring such beliefs to the next generation, and the ensuing effects on social mobility. In particular, we establish that people from more democratic societies have cultural values that are conducive to social mobility, that these views are retained after emigration, and are to some extent transmitted to second-generation immigrant children. We further show that this intergenerational transmission of cultural traits is strongly associated with second-generation immigrants' social mobility relative to their parents. Identification primarily focuses on within-origin country variation in democracy over time. We find that individuals whose parents hail from more democratic societies experience significantly more upward mobility on average.</div><br>
  
  <h3>International labor mobility, ethnic discrimination and economic development</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('pdf01');">pdf</a>] [<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('abs01');">abstract / summary</a>] [<a class="text" href="../blog/01-international-labor-mobility.html">blog</a>]</div>
  <div id="pdf01" class="hidden">PDF available upon request.</div>
  <div id="abs01" class="hidden">This paper examines the relationship between migration and discrimination, and how migration policy may affect discrimination. First, making use of a unique dataset, I confirm that there exists selection into emigration by ethnic or religious affiliation. The analysis indicates that this may be at least partially driven by discrimination. Second, building on the results of the empirical analysis, I extend a model of discrimination and migration, which reproduces the main conclusions drawn from the data. Third, the model is calibrated and simulated to shed more light on the research question. It is found that more liberal migration policies can alleviate discrimination in source countries. On the other hand, their effects on the migration rate can be either positive or negative depending on the type of reform, and they may reinforce inequalities in educational attainment among different ethnolinguistic or religious groups within a country.</div><br><br>

  <h3>Age diversity and economic growth</h3>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('pre01');">preliminary abstract</a>]</div>
  <div id="pre01" class="hidden">Age diversity has been shown in a variety of firm-level studies to matter for productivity. This paper asks whether such firm-level productivity gains can add up and be detected on the macroeconomic level. In other words, we ask whether age diversity matters for economic growth. Evidence is provided in cross-country panel data with a novel instrument, in regional European panel data, and on the grid-cell level using a novel data set. Findings suggest that age diversity has a significant positive effect on macro-level economic outcomes. In addition, the paper explores under what conditions age diversity is most beneficial. We find that economies more reliant on innovative activities such as R&D stand less to gain from age diversity.</div><br>
  
  <h3>Recycling, international trade, and the sectoral composition of economies</h3>
  <div class="date">joint with <a class="text" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jf_Garcia-Barragan" target="_blank">J.F. Garcia-Barragan</a></div>
  <div class="content">[<a class="text" href="javascript:unhide('pre02');">preliminary abstract</a>]</div>
  <div id="pre02" class="hidden">A number of major economies such as the European Union are considering the introduction of large-scale recycling schemes to reduce reliance on non-renewable raw materials. This paper investigates what the effects of such recycling schemes are on the sectoral composition of the domestic economy and its resource-rich trade partners. We build a multi-sector model of recycling and trade, which we calibrate and simulate. Our primary goal is to explore whether large-scale recycling in developed countries can help resource-rich developing countries transition from raw material extraction into manufacturing, or whether it hinders such transition.</div><br><br>
